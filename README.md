# Defenders of the humam body
A fun and exciting single player biological action edugame. 

# Introduction

This is a single-player biological action edugame, created using python with the help of the pygame library. The goal behind this project is to create a game that teaches basic biological concepts about the immune system in a fun way. 

I will also create a javascript version, using the p5.js framework. 

# Basics of the game

In this game, you are a leukocyte in the human body (immune system cell). Your objective is to defend the body from waves of pathogens (bacteria, fungi, etc) trying to harm your human. 

You can destroy pathogens in a variety of ways. Which pathogen you destroy and how you do it depends on the type of cell you are. 

The body that you are defending has a set amount of hit points. When a pathogen comes in contact with the top of the screen, the hitpoints decrease. When all the hit points are gone, you lose. You win if you destroy all the pathogens or if all the waves are over and you body still survives.
