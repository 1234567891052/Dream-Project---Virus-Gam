# Dream-Project---Virus-Game
A fun and exciting single player biological action game. 

# Introduction

This is a single-player biological action 'edugame' game, created using python with the help of the pygame library. The goal behind this project is to create a game that teaches basic biological concepts about the immune system in a fun way. 

I will also create a javascript version of the game, using the p5.js framework. 

# Basics of the game

In this game, you are an antibody in the human body (WBC cell). Your objective is to defend the body from waves of pathogens trying to harm your human. 
You can destroy pathogens by simply colliding with them. The body that you are defending has a set amount of hit points. When a pathogen comes in contact with the top of the screen, the hitpoints comd down. When the hit points reach zero, then you lose. If you destroy all the pathogens, then you win. 

Are you ready? Happy defending!
